<p><strong>Sub:</strong>&nbsp;<u>Request to withdraw the proposed project for 'Holistic Development of Great Nicobar Island in Andaman &amp; Nicobar Islands' by NITI Aayog</u></p>
<p>Most Respectfully,</p>
<p>The Great Nicobar Island, harbouring one of the richest repositories of biodiversity in the whole of South and Southeast Asia, might soon be history, as the Indian government works its way around on a contentious project, titled "Holistic Development of Great Nicobar Island". This ambitious initiative aims to turn the mostly remote and untouched Great Nicobar Island into a transshipment port and tourism hotspot. This petition is in regard to the potential severe impacts of the proposal, if not paid attention to and checked immediately.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Great Nicobar Island is a sheer treasure trove of biodiversity, consisting of Biosphere Reserve, Tribal Reserve, National Parks and Wildlife Sanctuaries. This island is perhaps one of the last untouched tropical evergreen rain forests of the world, with endemic fauna and flora much of which is undocumented and unknown to the scientific community. The Island covers an area of 910 sq. of which 865.84 (95.2%) is densely forested, within which is the tribal reserve for the Aboriginal Shompen Tribe comprising 751.40 sq. kms. 30 of the 51 nesting habitats of the Nicobar Megapod; a keystone species of the island, will be destroyed. The project also poses a threat to the habitat of unique species like leatherback turtles, the endemic Nicobar Macaque, Nicobar wild pig, Nicobar tree shrew, the Great Nicobar crested serpent eagle, Nicobar paradise flycatcher, and saltwater crocodiles. Two national parks, as part of the biosphere, the Galathea National Park (GNP) is spread over 107.10 sq. kms and the Campbell National Park (CNP) comprising 391.75 sq. kms. Hence, there is a very strong case to leave this last bastion of nature and biodiversity untouched in its pristine form for future generations. However, the proposed project cuts through the biosphere and apportions 70.6 sq.km into the project area.</li>
<li>Approximately 237 Shompen and 1,094 Nicobarese, are both important indigenous communities that inhabit the Great Nicobar Island. Though the Nicobarese have joined the mainstream, the Shompen Tribes still prefer living in the forests and continue their lives as aboriginal people, living deep within forests, as indigenous tribes world over, in their traditional manner. The Great Nicobarese, who are distinct from other Nicobarese societies of north or central Nicobar, are survived by only 420 members. The construction in question will permanently take away the ancestral villages of the Great Nicobarese. The tsunami-induced internal displacement and indiscriminate private/government doles have already diluted their traditional customs and place-based rituals and practices and have severely hampered their traditional livelihoods. Denying the Nicobarese the rightful ownership of their land is in violation of clause No. 3(4) of The Andaman and Nicobar Islands (Protection of Aboriginal Tribes) Regulation (1956). More than 50% of the project area falls under the Tribal Reserve. Approval of the first phase of the project has already led to the diversion of 130.75 sq.km of tropical evergreen rainforest for non-forest purposes against the wishes of the indigenous tribes. The Rs.72,000 crore project will be implemented over 30 years and is expected to bring more than three lakh people to the island during that time, this has the potential of disturbing the natural relationship of the indigenous communities with the environment.&nbsp;</li>
<li>At present, 95.2 % of the Great Nicobar Island is under pristine forest cover. The proposed project envisages slicing an area of 166 sq. kms. from the total 910 sq. kms which amounts to 18.25 % of the Island&rsquo;s total land mass being diverted for the project.The proposed megaproject envisages 8.5 lakhs trees will be felled and 300 hectares of land reclaimed from dredging up the ocean. These numbers that are presented by the government are valid only for the first phase of the project. The second phase will involve further clear felling of forest on much of the western coast of the island.&nbsp;</li>
<li>A very serious consideration is the role of rainforests being the carbon sinks of the world, and essential to the control of Co2 emissions. In view of the seriousness with which the world is pursuing transitions from fossil fuels to clean energy to cut carbon emissions/ global warming, if India proceeds with deforestation on a massive scale, the country would be deemed as one of the doublespeak, posing on global forums, and doing the opposite in its country. A negative image like that must be avoided under all circumstances.</li>
<li>Research has found that deforestation can heat a local area by as much as 4.5&deg;C and can even increase temperatures in undisturbed forests as far away as 6km. This research used satellite data over Indonesia, Malaysia, and Papua New Guinea (which fall in similar temperature zones as with other ASEAN countries). Rise in ocean surface temperatures in Nicobar are therefore imperative at the scale of deforestation this project proposes, which would affect the El Nino currents which originate in the Indian ocean area. As is well known, the El Nino impacts rainfall on the Indian peninsula, putting an existential threat on the mainland with skewed rainfall patterns and an increased intensity and frequency of extreme as well as erratic weather events. There are also concerns of the project due to tectonic volatility and disaster vulnerability of the island. 444 earthquakes occurred in the past 10 years in the region, this project risks aggravating the problem further.</li>
<li>However, effective forest management practices could increase the relevance of forests as a carbon sink, buying time for the switch to green energy sources even though the rapid decarbonization of the global economy is still necessary. The risk of losing native forests is quite significant, and it includes the loss of the indigenous people's livelihoods that depend on their surrounding environment. Without sufficient protective measures, environmental wrongdoing will start to erode the barrier created by indigenous territory and other protected places.</li>
<li>The claimed &lsquo;Holistic&rsquo; Development by Govt. of India, MoEFCC fails in as being neither holistic or all encompassing; as it violates the fundamental Environmental Laws Rules and Regulations of the country, preserving the Great Nicobar Biosphere, Protection of National Parks of Great Nicobar, protecting endemic and endangered Wildlife of Great Nicobar, and encroaching on Reserved Forest of indigenous tribes and against the Tribal Policy of Shompen Tribe of Great Nicobar;</li>
<li>Hence the &lsquo;<strong>Holistic Development of Great Nicobar Island in Andaman</strong> &amp; <strong>Nicobar Islands</strong>' by NITI Aayog is against nature, indigenous tribes, endangered and endemic flora and fauna and pursues a solely economic agenda, <strong>and therefore needs to be scrapped forthwith and the Great Nicobar Island left in its pristine condition without any further anthropogenic interventions.</strong></li>
