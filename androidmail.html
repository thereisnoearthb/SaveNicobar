          <strong>Sub:</strong>
          <u>
            Great Nicobar Rainforest Island Development Megaproject
          </u>
        </p>
        <p>
          Most Respectfully,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The Great Nicobar Island is a sheer treasure trove of biodiversity, consisting of Biosphere Reserve, Tribal
          Reserve,
          National Parks and Wildlife Sanctuaries. This island is perhaps one of the last untouched tropical evergreen
          rain
          forests of the world, with endemic fauna and flora much of which is undocumented and unknown to the scientific
          community. The Island covers an area of 910 sq. of which 865.84 (95.2%) is densely forested, within which is
          the tribal
          reserve for the Aboriginal Shompen Tribe comprising 751.40 sq. kms. Two national parks, as part of the
          biosphere, the
          Galathea National Park (GNP) spread over 107.10 sq. kms and the Campbell National Park (CNP) 391.75 comprising
          sq. kms.
          Hence there is a very strong case to leave this last bastion of nature and biodiversity untouched in its
          pristine form
          for future generations. However, the proposed project cuts through the biosphere and apportions 70.6 sq.km
          into the
          project area.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Great Nicobar Island is inhabited by aboriginal Shompen and Nicobarese, Shompen are approximately 237 and
          the
          Nicobarese 1,094 individuals. Though the Nicobarese have joined mainstream, the Shompen Tribes still prefer
          living in
          the forests and continue their lives as aboriginal people, living deep within forests, as indigenous tribes
          world over,
          in their traditional manner (can be explained in greater detail if required, however Government
          instrumentalities have
          extensive knowledge and know the necessity of protecting and preserving the indigenous people in their own
          lands/forests)
        </p>
        <p>
          3. At the present moment, 95.2% of the Great Nicobar Island is under pristine forest cover, the proposed
          project
          envisages slicing an area of 166 sq. kms. from the total 910 sq. kms which amounts to <u>18.25% of the
            Island’s total land
            mass being diverted for the project</u>. The proposed megaproject envisages 8.5 lakhs trees will be felled
          and 300 hectares
          of land reclaimed from dredging up the ocean.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. A very serious consideration is the role of rainforests being the carbon sinks of the world, and essential
          to the
          control of Co2 emissions, which is essential to restrict warming of the planet. In view of the seriousness
          with which
          the world is pursuing transitions from fossil fuels to clean energy to cut carbon emissions / global warming,
          if India
          proceeds with deforestation on such a massive scale, its will show the country as one of doublespeak, speaking
          on global
          forums, and doing the opposite in its country. Such a negative image must be avoided under all circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Further, no studies have been undertaken on what impact such extensive deforestation will have on ocean
          temperatures;
          it will certainly lead to a rise in ocean surface temperatures, which will give rise to the El Nino effect, As
          is well
          known the El Nino impacts rainfall on the Indian peninsula, which will put an existential threat on the
          mainland with
          skewed rainfall patterns and an increased intensity and frequency of extreme/freak weather events.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. The claimed ‘Holistic’ Development by Govt. of India, MoEFCC fails in as as being neither holistic or all
          encompassing; it violates all fundamental Environmental Laws Rules and Regulations of the country, preserving
          the Great
          Nicobar Biosphere, Protection of National Parks of Great Nicobar, protecting endemic and endangered Wildlife
          of Great
          Nicobar, and encroaching on Reserved Forest of indigenous tribes and against the Tribal Policy of Shompen
          Tribe of Great
          Nicobar;
        </p>
        <p>
          7. Hence the entire Mega Project is against nature, indigenous tribes, endangered and endemic flora and fauna
          and
          pursues a solely economic agenda, <u><strong>and therefore deserves to be scrapped forthwith and the Great
              Nicobar Island left in
              its pristine condition without any further anthropogenic interventions</strong></u>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eagerly anticipating an immediate, careful, and most urgent consideration of the above matter from your end.
        </p>
