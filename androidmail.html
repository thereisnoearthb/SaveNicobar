            Request to withdraw the proposed project for 'Holistic Development of Great Nicobar Island in Andaman &
            Nicobar Islands' by NITI Aayog
          </u>
        </p>
        <p>
          Most Respectfully,
        </p>
        <p>
          The Great Nicobar Island, harbouring one of the richest repositories of biodiversity in the whole South and
          Southeast
          Asia, might soon be history, as the Indian government works its way around on a contentious project, called
          "Holistic
          Development of Great Nicobar Island". The ambitious initiative aims to turn the mostly remote and untouched
          Great
          Nicobar Island into a transshipment port and tourism hotspot. This petition is in regard to the potential
          severe impacts
          of the proposal, if not paid attention to and checked immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The Great Nicobar Island is a sheer treasure trove of biodiversity, consisting of Biosphere Reserve, Tribal
          Reserve,
          National Parks and Wildlife Sanctuaries. This island is perhaps one of the last untouched tropical evergreen
          rain
          forests of the world, with endemic fauna and flora much of which is undocumented and unknown to the scientific
          community. The Island covers an area of 910 sq. of which 865.84 (95.2%) is densely forested, within which is
          the tribal
          reserve for the Aboriginal Shompen Tribe comprising 751.40 sq. kms. Two national parks, as part of the
          biosphere, the
          Galathea National Park (GNP) is spread over 107.10 sq. kms and the Campbell National Park (CNP) comprising
          391.75 sq.
          kms. <u>Hence, there is a very strong case to leave this last bastion of nature and biodiversity untouched in
            its pristine
            form for future generations.</u> However, the proposed project cuts through the biosphere and apportions
          70.6 sq.km into the
          project area
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Great Nicobar Island is inhabited by aboriginal Shompen and Nicobarese, Shompen are approximately 237 and
          the
          Nicobarese 1,094 individuals. Though the Nicobarese have joined mainstream, the Shompen Tribes still prefer
          living in
          the forests and continue their lives as aboriginal people, living deep within forests, as indigenous tribes
          world over,
          in their traditional manner (can be explained in greater detail if required, however Government
          instrumentalities have
          extensive knowledge and know the necessity of protecting and preserving the indigenous people in their own
          lands/forests).
        </p>
        <p>
          3. At present, 95.2% of the Great Nicobar Island is under pristine forest cover. The proposed project
          envisages slicing
          an area of 166 sq. kms. from the total 910 sq. kms which amounts to <u>18.25% of the Island's total land mass
            being
            diverted for the project</u>. The proposed megaproject envisages 8.5 lakhs trees will be felled and 300
          hectares of land
          reclaimed from dredging up the ocean.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. A very serious consideration is the role of rainforests being the carbon sinks of the world, and essential
          to the
          control of Co2 emissions needed to restrict warming of the planet. In view of the seriousness with which the
          world is
          pursuing transitions from fossil fuels to clean energy to cut carbon emissions/ global warming, if India
          proceeds with
          deforestation on a massive scale, the country would be deemed as one of the doublespeak, posingon global
          forums, and
          doing the opposite in its country. a negative image like that must be avoided under all circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Research has found that deforestation can heat a local area by as much as 4.5°C and can even increase temperatures in undisturbed forests as far away as 6km. This research used satellite data over Indonesia, Malaysia, and Papua New Guinea (which fall in similar temperature zones as with other ASEAN countries). Rise in ocean surface temperatures in Nicobar are therefore imperative at the scale of deforestation this project proposes, which would affect the El Nino currents which originate in the Indian ocean area.  As is well known, the El Nino impacts rainfall on the Indian peninsula, putting an existential threat on the mainland with skewed rainfall patterns and an increased intensity and frequency of extreme as well as erratic weather events.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. However, effective forest management practices could increase the relevance of forests as a carbon sink, buying time for the switch to green energy sources even though the rapid decarbonization of the global economy is still necessary. The risk of losing native forests is quite significant, and it includes the loss of the indigenous people's livelihoods that depend on their surrounding environment. Without sufficient protective measures, environmental wrongdoing will start to erode the barrier created by indigenous territory and other protected places.

        </p>
        <p>
            The claimed ‘Holistic’ Development by Govt. of India, MoEFCC fails in as being neither holistic or all encompassing; as it violates the fundamental Environmental Laws Rules and Regulations of the country, preserving the Great Nicobar Biosphere, Protection of National Parks of Great Nicobar, protecting endemic and endangered Wildlife of Great Nicobar, and encroaching on Reserved Forest of indigenous tribes and against the Tribal Policy of Shompen Tribe of Great Nicobar;

        </p>
        <p>
          8. Hence the 'Holistic Development of Great Nicobar Island in Andaman & Nicobar Islands' is against nature,
          indigenous tribes, endangered and endemic flora and fauna and pursues a solely economic agenda,
          <u><strong>
              and therefore deserves to be scrapped forthwith and the Great Nicobar Island left in its pristine
              condition without any further anthropogenic interventions.
            </strong></u>
